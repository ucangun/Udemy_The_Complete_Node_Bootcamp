# The Complete Node.js Bootcamp

This repository contains the projects and exercises completed during the **The Complete Node.js Bootcamp** Udemy course. The focus of this course was to build a strong foundation in backend development using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, while also gaining hands-on experience with databases, APIs, authentication, and real-world application deployment.

## ðŸ›  Key Features

- **Node.js**: Understanding the core concepts of Node.js, including asynchronous programming, event-driven architecture, and handling HTTP requests.
- **Express.js**: Mastering Express to build scalable web applications and APIs with robust routing and middleware support.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: Learning how to integrate MongoDB, create schemas, perform CRUD operations, and work with Mongoose.
- **Authentication & Security**: Implementing secure authentication methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and OAuth for user management.
- **Real-World Projects**: Building full-fledged applications, from REST APIs to real-time communication with web sockets.
- **Testing & Debugging**: Implementing unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability and application performance.
